# Loopy

> A daily path-drawing puzzle game with constraint satisfaction mechanics. Draw continuous loops where numbered cells indicate how many corners (turns) your path must make in the surrounding 3x3 area.

## Game Overview

Loopy is a free browser-based puzzle game available at https://loopy.wtf. Players draw a single continuous path that forms a closed loop, satisfying numbered constraint hints placed throughout the grid.

## Core Mechanics

- **Objective**: Draw one continuous path forming a closed loop
- **Movement**: Path can only move up, down, left, right (no diagonals)
- **Constraints**: Numbered cells show how many turns (corners) the path must make in the surrounding 3×3 area
- **Victory**: Complete a valid loop satisfying all constraints (does not need to visit every cell)
- **Turn Definition**: A corner/bend in the path (straight = 0 turns, corner = 1 turn)

## Game Modes

- **Daily Puzzles**: Three difficulty levels (Easy 4×4, Medium 6×6, Hard 8×8) with deterministic generation - everyone gets the same puzzle each day
